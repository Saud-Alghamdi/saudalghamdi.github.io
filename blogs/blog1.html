                    Let's get right to the point: In bodybuilding, no one is ever going to hand you a routine that will magically turn you into a physique competitor overnight. It takes years of hard work—and lots of trial and error—to achieve your dream physique. We can make recommendations about the best exercises, successful sets-and-reps schemes, and our favorite training techniques, but at the end of the day you're the judge and jury about whether something works for your body.

                    <br><br>

                    This is never more apparent than when organizing your bodybuilding program. Devising your workout and your training "split" (which body parts you do on a given day over the course of a week) revolves around factors that are specific to you.

                    <br><br>

                    When setting up your split, elements that you need to consider include:

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><em><u>1. Your Training Experience</em></u></h3> 

                    <br>

                    Beginners require less volume and intensity in their training programs—but often greater frequency—than advanced lifters.

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><em><u>2. Your Goals</em></u></h3>

                    <br>

                    Are you trying to establish a baseline of fitness, maintain your shape, or pursue larger-scale physique changes?

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><em><u>3. Your Availability</em></u></h3>

                    <br>

                    Can you commit to working out five days per week, or is your schedule so tight you can't afford to make gym time on more than a few days? Whichever it is, realize that each bodybuilding workout builds upon the previous one, so you need to be willing to hit the gym at least three days per week.

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><em><u>4. Your Rest And Recovery Needs</em></u></h3>

                    <br>

                    Depending on your job, lifestyle, and recovery abilities (including sleep), you may need more or fewer rest days. Rest days shouldn't be trivialized in your pursuit for more muscle. Growth takes place away from the gym, in the presence of good nutrition and adequate rest. In terms of recovery, you don't want to train a muscle group that's still ludicrously sore from a previous workout.

                    <br><br>

                    "You need to learn to listen to your body," says New Orleans IFBB bikini pro Barbara Bolotte, 2011 Optimum Classic winner and BPI Sports athlete. "For me, if I have really sore legs, I'll work arms instead."

                    <br><br>

                    Recovery can also include mental recharging: If you're feeling burned out from too much time in the gym, including more rest days can really help.

                    <br><br>

                    "I designate one day per week for outdoor training," adds Bolotte. "So I do a track workout or a long-distance run. I think this is just as important for your mental [and] physical well-being because it helps change your mindset from a constant gym atmosphere."

                    <br><br>

                    <h3><em><u>5. Your Weaknesses</em></u></h3>

                    <br>

                    If you have a body part that you need to improve, do it first after a rest day when your energy stores are fully restocked. In addition, with longer splits, you may be able to add a second training session for that muscle group to better emphasize it.
