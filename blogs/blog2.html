                Nope, we're not here to discuss an unquestionably delicious and potentially healthy treat for Sunday dinner. This is about your legs. People with chicken legs are also sometimes compared to an upside-down triangle, or told that they're top heavy, if they've focused all their energy at the gym on their upper half.

                <br><br>

                The result — thin, underdeveloped, bony, legs that are much less chiseled than the rest of their bodies — isn't pretty. Chicken legs are bad enough in couch-sitters, but in folks who actually do work out, there's just no excuse for this phenomenon. 

                <br><br>

                How do you know whether you've got a pair of chicken legs? Don't wait for friends to start making fun of you. Take charge today. 

                <br><br>

                <h3>Why Are Chicken Legs Bad News?</h3>

                <br>

                While a variety of factors contribute to the hated phenomenon more commonly known as chicken legs, in gym goers, the underlying reason is almost always the same — over-training easily visible muscle groups, like the arms/biceps and the torso, while neglecting the leg work. 

                <br><br>

                You get a slightly odd aesthetic if you do this, yes, but that's far from the only reason why chicken legs are bad news. 

                <br><br>

                Even if you're a sedentary kind of person, and you have a few more pounds than the old BMI scale shows to be optimal, the placement of your body fat matters a great deal, research has shown.

                <br><br>

                Fat that's distributed around the waist, medically known as central obesity, leads to a much higher risk of cardiovascular disease and “metabolic diseases” (including type 2 diabetes) than seen in people whose body fat accumulates mainly in their legs. 

                <br><br>

                In fact, leg fat and larger legs could have some protective benefits, by reducing the odds of these bad outcomes not just compared to people with central obesity, but also to those with extremely thin lower extremities (AKA chicken legs).

                <br><br>

                Having a higher muscle mass in your legs also, meanwhile, simply makes you h5er and more well-balanced, which can slash your odds of injury and increase your metabolism.
